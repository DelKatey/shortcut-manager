## Introduction

Use multiple browsers, or just don't like to keep your favourites/bookmarks in one browser? Desktop getting cluttered from all the internet shortcuts? With this, that can be avoided!

## Usage

Just drag-and-drop from either the browser's address bar, or an internet shortcut from the desktop/folder, and onto the program, to add it, when in "Editing" mode. To drag-and-drop from the program into a folder or the desktop, switch to "Drag & Drop" mode.

Shortcuts can be added or edited whilst in the list, as well as being deleted.

Multiple shortcut lists can be managed, and saved by names of your own preference, and loaded from anywhere.

## Installation

This was coded with Visual Studio 2010, using .NET Framework 3.5, and should thus be usable with any version of Visual Studio 2010 and up, as well as SharpDevelop. Compatibility wise, it should present no challenges in being converted to use a newer version of the .NET Framework.

![.NET Framework 3.5](https://public-dm2306.files.1drv.com/y3pXtgOa3VAq1KJC17mOmtDEPHusKHAB9-7yuC54hI8Y09iMHkj7cSTqPzm-c2hu7OPOEI-ixow1bGvhOElUZRiFtFmgt8BNExvufrWkuXzyzmYY1WE-v_-1nYVuGdbqrPq/NET-Frmwrk_h_rgb.png?rdrts=142979546)
